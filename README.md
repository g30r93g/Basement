# Basement

A social music platform that allows you to listen with your friends, regardless of streaming platform

## A Brief History

During the 2020 COVID pandemic, content consumption increased dramatically since everyone was staying at home. One night, after using netflix party to watch a film with my friends, I thought, "Why doesn't something like this for music exist?" Music is an extremely personal thing like films, its hit and miss, but you watch what's recommended to you, whether that be by an algorithm or a person. It seems that nowadays we've lost the "here try this cassette" attitude and left it to the algos to tell us what we should be listening to. Our friends listen to all kinds of music that is quirky, new and underground. Sharing this listening data and allowing our friends to listen along with us brings back an element of music discovery that isn't as prominent as it once was. By resurfacing an old trend, new and upcoming artists will be more visible and prominent, and listeners will have a new sound to enjoy.
